# Circulation App

Circulation App is a full-stack JavaScript application designed to facilitate the management of room assignments in a library or academic setting. This app keeps track of the rooms, their statuses, and the students assigned to each room. The app includes features to search for students, assign them to rooms, and monitor room statuses.

## Tech Stack

- Node.js: Back-end JavaScript runtime
- Express.js: Web application framework for Node.js
- MongoDB: NoSQL database
- Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS: Front-end technologies

## Functionality

CirculationApp offers several features:

- **Room Listing**: List of all rooms, their numbers, and their current statuses.
- **Room Details**: Detailed view of a specific room, including assigned students and room history.
- **Student Search**: Search functionality for students based on their names, IDs, or email addresses.
- **Room Assignment**: Functionality for assigning a student to a room.

## Future Developments

I am continuously working to improve the CirculationApp and expand its functionality. Future updates will include the addition of an "End of Semester Update Form" for easier management of room assignments between semesters.
