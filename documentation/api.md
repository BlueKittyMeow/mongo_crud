## `/api/rooms` 

**Method:** GET

**Parameters:** 

No parameters needed.

**Return Value:** 

An array of all room objects from the database.

**Behavior:** 

Fetches all room data from the 'spaces' collection in the database and returns it as an array of room objects.

**Errors:** 

Returns a 500 status and the message 'Internal server error' if an error occurs while processing the request.

**Notes:**
GPT: This endpoint seems pretty straightforward as it fetches all the room data available in the 'spaces' collection. However, it's worth noting that if the number of rooms in your database becomes very large, it might be more efficient to add pagination or filtering mechanisms to prevent the app from having to fetch and process too much data at once.


## `/api/rooms/number/:room_number`

**Method:** GET

**URL Parameters:** 

- `room_number`: A string indicating the room number to fetch.

**Return Value:** 

A room object that matches the provided room number. If the room has any assignees, an array of the corresponding student objects is added to the room object.

**Behavior:** 

Searches the 'spaces' collection in the database for a room with the provided room number. If a room is found, it fetches any students currently assigned to the room from the 'students' collection and adds them to the room object. If no room is found, it returns a 404 status and the message 'Room not found'.

**Errors:** 

Returns a 500 status and the message 'Internal server error' if an error occurs while processing the request. If no room with the specified room number is found, it returns a 404 status and the message 'Room not found'.

**Notes:**
GPT: This endpoint looks more complex than the previous ones. It involves finding a room and then getting all the associated students. This is an excellent example of where MongoDB Aggregation Pipelines can help, as you can combine both operations into a single query. 

## `/api/rooms/number/:room_number` (Continued)

**Method:** GET

**Return Value (Continued):**

The room object returned includes a `students` property, which is an array of student objects currently assigned to the room.

**Behavior (Continued):**

After fetching the room and the associated students, the API adds the `students` data to the room object before returning the object in the response.

**Errors (Continued):**

Returns a 500 status and the message 'Internal server error' if an error occurs while processing the request.

**Notes:**
GPT: It seems like the piece of code you've shared is a continuation of the previous endpoint. The code gets the students assigned to a particular room and adds them to the room object, which is then sent as a response.
The key point here is that the returned room object includes a students property, which consists of an array of the students currently assigned to the room.
Again, keep in mind the potential usefulness of Aggregation Pipelines in MongoDB to optimize this kind of multi-stage data fetching and transformation process. 

As for whether this should be broken down into multiple endpoints, it depends on your specific needs and how the API is being used. It's often a good idea to have specific endpoints for updating individual pieces of data (like updating just the room_status or just the room_notes), but having a single endpoint for updating multiple pieces of data can also be useful in reducing the number of API calls that need to be made. 

## `/api/rooms/number/:room_number`

**Method:** PUT

**URL Parameters:** 

- `room_number`: A string indicating the room number to update.

**Request Body:**

- `room_status`: (Optional) The updated status of the room.
- `admin_notes`: (Optional) The updated admin notes for the room.
- `room_notes`: (Optional) The updated room notes.
- `currentAssignees`: (Optional) An array of the updated IDs of students currently assigned to the room.
- `roomHistory`: (Optional) An array of the updated room history records.

**Behavior:** 

Updates the room data in the 'spaces' collection with the provided room number using the data provided in the request body. Only the fields provided in the request body will be updated.

**Return Value:** 

Sends a 200 status if the operation is successful.

**Errors:** 

Returns a 500 status and the message 'Internal server error' if an error occurs while processing the request.


## `/api/students/ids/:ids`

**Method:** GET

**URL Parameters:** 

- `ids`: A comma-separated string of student Pratt IDs to fetch.

**Behavior:** 

Fetches an array of student records from the 'students' collection based on the provided Pratt IDs. Only students whose Pratt IDs are included in the provided `ids` parameter will be returned. 

**Return Value:** 

Returns a JSON array of matching student records.

**Errors:** 

Returns a 500 status and the message 'Internal server error' if an error occurs while processing the request.

**Notes:**
GPT: The :ids parameter is treated as a string. The endpoint splits the string by comma, converts each part to an integer, and discards any non-integer values. Therefore, the endpoint expects ids to be a comma-separated string of integer values.

## `/api/students`

**Method:** POST

**Request Body Parameters:** 

- `first_name`: The student's first name.
- `last_name`: The student's last name.
- `pratt_id`: The student's Pratt ID.
- `email`: The student's email address.
- `legal_first_name`: The student's legal first name.
- `enrollment_status_current`: The student's current enrollment status.

**Behavior:** 

Creates a new student record in the 'students' collection with the data provided in the request body. 

**Return Value:** 

Sends a 200 status if the student record was successfully added.

**Errors:** 

Returns a 500 status and the message 'Internal server error' if an error occurs while processing the request.

**Notes:**
GPT: The endpoint expects the request body to be JSON formatted, and each parameter is required to create the new student record. If any of these parameters are not included in the request body, the behavior of the endpoint is not defined in the provided code.

## `/api/rooms`

**Method:** POST

**Request Body Parameters:** 

The request body should contain a JSON object representing the room to be added. The required fields and their meanings are not defined in the provided code, but it's expected that the room object will contain all necessary details.

**Behavior:** 

Creates a new room record in the 'spaces' collection with the data provided in the request body. 

**Return Value:** 

Sends a 200 status if the room record was successfully added.

**Errors:** 

Returns a 500 status and the message 'Internal server error' if an error occurs while processing the request.

**Notes:** The endpoint expects the request body to be JSON formatted. If the room object doesn't include all necessary fields, the behavior of the endpoint is not defined in the provided code.





## `/api/students/search` 

**Method:** GET

**Parameters:** 

- `type`: A string indicating the type of search to perform. Can be 'id', 'email', or 'name'.
- `term`: A string containing the search term.

**Behavior:** 

Searches the database for students that match the given `type` and `term`. Only returns students with `enrollment_status_current` set to true.

**Return Value:** 

Returns an array of student objects matching the search criteria.

**Errors:** 

Returns a 500 status and the message 'Internal server error' if an error occurs while processing the request.

**Notes:**

1. **Performance:** As the application grows and more students are added to the database, search performance may start to degrade. Consider adding an indexing strategy to the fields that are frequently used in searches (i.e., `pratt_id`, `email`, and `first_name`/`last_name`).

2. **Search Types:** Currently, the search functionality is limited to `id`, `email`, and `name`. As the application evolves, other search parameters might be useful. Consider the feasibility and performance implications of expanding search functionality.

3. **Data Privacy:** Depending on the context in which the application is used, searching for students by email or name might raise data privacy concerns. Always ensure the application complies with relevant data privacy laws and regulations.



## `/api/rooms/:room_id/assignees/:student_id`

**Method:** PUT

**URL Parameters:**

- `room_id` - A string representing the ObjectId of the room to which the student will be assigned.
- `student_id` - A string representing the ObjectId of the student to be assigned to the room.

**Behavior:**

Updates the specified room record in the 'spaces' collection by adding the specified student_id to the 'currentAssignees' array. If the room with the specified `room_id` does not exist or `student_id` is not valid, the behavior of the endpoint is not defined in the provided code.

**Return Value:**

Sends a 200 status if the update was successful.

**Errors:**

Returns a 500 status and the message 'Internal server error' if an error occurs while processing the request.

**Note:** This endpoint does not check whether the student_id already exists in the 'currentAssignees' array. So if this endpoint is called multiple times with the same `room_id` and `student_id`, the same `student_id` will be added to the 'currentAssignees' array multiple times. To avoid this, you may want to refactor this endpoint to check whether the `student_id` is already in the 'currentAssignees' array before adding it.

## `/api/room_types`

**Method:** GET

**URL Parameters:** None

**Behavior:**

Fetches all records from the 'room_types' collection. This endpoint does not support any sort of filtering, so it will always return all room types.

**Return Value:**

Returns an array of objects, each representing a room type. The structure of these objects will depend on the schema of your 'room_types' collection.

**Errors:**

Returns a 500 status and the message 'Internal server error' if an error occurs while processing the request.

**Note:** As the endpoint stands, it fetches all room types regardless of their status or relevance. If you have a large number of room types or if some are deprecated or irrelevant, this might result in unneeded data being sent over the network. You might want to consider adding filtering capabilities or an 'active' status to your room types.
